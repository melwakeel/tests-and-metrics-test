$ netstat_app -h

if no number of samples is passed, default will be 1
app can be used without inserting additional headers.

SKTEST;<IP address of HTTP server>;<HTTP response code>;<median of CURLINFO_NAMELOOKUP_TIME>;<median of CURLINFO_CONNECT_TIME>;<median of CURLINFO_STARTTRANSFER_TIME>;<median of CURLINFO_TOTAL_TIME>
