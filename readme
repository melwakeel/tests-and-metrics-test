Hello and welcome to my submission.

Folder structure is as follows:
- src: source file for netstat library
- include: public header file for lib users
- app: source code for the test app
- lib: shared lib .so file generated after building the library
- bin: binary of app generated after running build script
- doc: html doxygen documentation of the API and a simple user guide
- tools: scripts writen to build the library, the test app, and automate documentation generation

Note curl needs to be installed on the system to properly build and use the library.
to install the libcurl, use following command
$ sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev

This library took me 10 hours to complete. some of the time was spent familiarizing myself with libcurl, 
and some time spent thinking about good names for variables and functions :)

You can find readme in each of the folders detailing what to expect and how to use.

if you want to save time, my advice is to go the doxygen documentation and read mainpage (index.html).
It contains a very simple getting started code snippet and some basic rationale :)

GOOD LUCK
