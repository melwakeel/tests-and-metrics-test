This folder has 4 scripts

- build_lib.sh generates a new shared library .so file and replaces the old one with the newly generated file in lib/libnetstat.so
- build_and_install_lib.sh does exactly as above but also copies the library to /usr/local/ directory for other system apps to be able to use it
- buid_App.sh builds the test app and copies the binary to app/netstat_app 
- generate_doc.sh updates the documentation to latest changes in library.
